I hate to get all binary on you but there really is only two ways of thinking about your marketing campaign. There’s the old way (will explain this in a minute) and the up-to-the-minute, so new-you-can-smell-it, still-bleeding-through-the page new way which takes advantage of all the new behaviors of modern web browsing including gestures, pinching, zooming and swiping. Unfortunately, marketers are still boxed in by developers or technology that still doesn’t respond to their needs because for some reason most devs still proudly aspire to be robots without any appreciation for 360 degree beauty or modern web metrics (sorry =/ #rantover)
But, there’s still hope…your users can engage your products in so many cool ways not by being sold on mindlessly clicking but by doing this or how about this? And most importantly we can move away from bait and click tactics and finally work together to (say it with me) #KillTheClick.
Unfortunately, some of you will still resist and cling to the old way (see above) of CPCs and C2Cs that literally started when the first anchor tag was born circa 1990. No worries and/or judgement here though friend. When you’re ready to write my name and number down in your TrapperKeeper, I’ll still be here for you… check my bio for my info or call.
